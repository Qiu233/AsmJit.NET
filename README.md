WASTED, I'll rewrite asmjit with C# months later.  
AsmJit.NET is managed wrapper for asmjit and it's programed in C++/CLI.  
For the time being, only assembler is completed, and it's only for .NET Framework.
Currently only for .NET Framework.  
Still in progress,needing HELP.  
More information to be seen in issues.
